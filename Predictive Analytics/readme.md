# 📊 Predictive Analytics in Excel: Appliance Sales Forecasting

This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be applied in Excel to forecast sales of appliances using historical data. The analysis focuses on four major product lines from an appliance manufacturer, with data spanning **four years (2019–2022)** and organized by **calendar quarters**.

The forecasting aims to assist the sales analyst in projecting demand for the coming year, using established techniques such as descriptive statistics, seasonality analysis, regression modeling, and visual trend analysis.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 🌀 Elemental Clothes Dryer

- **Approach**: Baseline demand analysis
- **Tools Used**: Excel *Data Analysis Toolpak → Descriptive Statistics*
- **Metrics Calculated**:
  - Mean of units sold
  - Standard deviation
  - Expected upper and lower limits
- **Visualization**:
  - Line chart showing units sold over time (quarters)
  - Interpretation: No significant trend or seasonality—sales driven by replacements

---

### ❄️ Absolute Zero Icemaker

- **Approach**: Seasonality and baseline analysis
- **Analysis Steps**:
  - Calculated mean and standard deviation of total units sold
  - Determined annual average sales
  - Computed **quarterly seasonality indices** and their average
  - Deseasonalized the data to remove seasonal effects
  - Forecasted deseasonalized future sales
  - Reapplied seasonal indices to forecast final values
  - Estimated upper and lower forecast bounds
- **Visualizations**:
  - Seasonal sales pattern highlighted in line graph

---

### 🍳 Signature Stove

- **Approach**: Trend analysis using linear regression
- **Tools Used**: Excel *Data Analysis Toolpak → Regression*
- **Analysis Steps**:
  - Plotted unit sales over time
  - Observed baseline and upward trend in graph
  - Generated regression output (intercept and slope)
  - Displayed trendline with equation (`y = mx + c`) and **R² value** to measure fit
- **Interpretation**:
  - Product is growing steadily since launch, showing increasing adoption

### 🧠 Intelli-chill Refrigerator

- **Approach**: Combined seasonality and trend analysis
- **Analysis Steps**:
  - Calculated mean and standard deviation of total sales
  - Computed annual averages
  - Derived seasonality indices and averages
  - Deseasonalized historical sales data
  - Applied linear trend to deseasonalized values for future forecast
  - Reintroduced seasonality and estimated upper/lower bounds
- **Visualizations**:
  - One chart for seasonal fluctuations
  - One chart showing trend with regression line and R²

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Data Analysis Toolpak (Descriptive Statistics, Regression)
  - Formulas: `AVERAGE`, `STDEV`, custom seasonal index calculations
  - Forecast models: Trendline forecasting, deseasonalization
  - Charts: Line graphs, trendlines with equation and R²
- **Forecasting Techniques**
  - Baseline detection
  - Seasonality analysis
  - Linear trend modeling
  - Deseasonalized forecasting
  - Confidence range estimation

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Clothes Dryer**: Steady demand with little variation; replacement-driven sales
